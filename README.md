# OnionsAndWagons
A Unity project to bring the True essence of Table Top D&amp;D to the computer.

## What's the gameplan?
We are working to create a D&D adventure game using the core rules and mechanics of the table top game. The goal is to give the player the real feeling of playing D&D, without needing to purchase any books or dice, or find friends.

### Development Tasks
1. Three different Character control levels
   - Local control (5ft x 5ft grid, combat)
   - Town Hub (Rest, shops)
   - Travel Lanes (Travel long distances, random enounters)
   
2. Core D&D Combat Mechanics
   - Initiative
   - Melee, ranged, magic
   - Taking prisoners
   - Looting
   
3. A world to explore
   - Towns and Cities
     - Shops
     - Taverns and Inns
     - Quests and jobs
   - Travel Long Distances
     - Stay fed and hydrated
     - Random encounters

4. The World Moves with (and without) You
   - Persistent shops and NPCs
   - Time based quests and events
   - Permadeath

More coming soon...
