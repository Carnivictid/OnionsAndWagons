# OnionsAndWagons
A Unity project to bring the True essence of Table Top D&amp;D to the computer.

## What's the gameplan?
We are working to create a D&D adventure game using the core rules and mechanics of the table top game. The goal is to give the player the real feeling of playing D&D, without needing to purchase any books or dice, or find friends.

### Development Tasks
Three different Character control levels
- Local control (5ft x 5ft grid, combat)
- Town Hub (Rest, shops)
- Travel Lanes (Travel long distances, random enounters)


More coming soon...
